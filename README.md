**What is Pixia** : 

Pixia is our submission to GCPU AI for Impact 2025. We focused on education and a familiar pain point: reviewing effectively before an exam with a personal, on‑demand helper. Pixia centralizes this with a multi‑agent architecture (Google ADK), specialized tools (MCP, course/exercise generation), and a FastAPI backend connected to PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL), deployed on Cloud Run.
